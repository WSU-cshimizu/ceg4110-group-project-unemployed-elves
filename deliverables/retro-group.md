# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* We communicated pretty well with each other by creating a discord server and leaving messages whenever we would not be attending class or if we needed too
coordinate outside of class.

## What could have been better in the group...
* We committed to the first project idea thought up instead of brainstorming different options and then making a weighted decision. I think next time
it would be helpful to evaluate our options prior to making a final move.

## What went well in the class...
* I really liked being introduced to all the different SWE concepts taught in the class. While it was difficult for me to fully
emerse myself in the content this semester, I plan on using this course and a locally cloned repository as a template for personal projects
once I have more time. This means incorporating SOLID design, modeling, user stories, etc into my design process.
