# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* We communicated pretty well with each other by creating a discord server and leaving messages whenever we would not be attending class or if we needed too
coordinate outside of class.
* We divided the tasks effectively based on individual strengths, which helped us complete the project more efficiently.
* Even though we changed our project perspective multiple times, we managed to stay organized and complete it on time.


## What could have been better in the group...
* We committed to the first project idea thought up instead of brainstorming different options and then making a weighted decision. I think next time
it would be helpful to evaluate our options prior to making a final move.
* While we accomplished our tasks, creating a more detailed plan at the beginning of the project could have made our workflow smoother and more efficient.
* It was hard to understand what and when everyone should do things, even though we had considered some deadlines, because we didnâ€™t assign a team lead who actually had the authority to delegate tasks and give directions.

## What went well in the class...
* I really liked being introduced to all the different SWE concepts taught in the class. While it was difficult for me to fully
emerse myself in the content this semester, I plan on using this course and a locally cloned repository as a template for personal projects
once I have more time. This means incorporating SOLID design, modeling, user stories, etc into my design process.
* One thing that went really well in the class was the guest lecture where we learned about real-world business applications.
The models and strategies they shared, such as project management workflows, team collaboration techniques, and problem-solving approaches,
were directly relatable to the concepts we studied in class.


## What could have been better in the class...
* It was a little poorly planned, specifically with the number of cancelled class days or days when the professor was out.
* Some lectures could have been more interactive by including live examples, case studies, or group discussions to make the concepts easier to understand.
