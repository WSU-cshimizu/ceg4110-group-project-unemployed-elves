## Project Description
One big issue faced by Amazon delivery drivers is proper documentation of issues with the van. The app will help keep track of the van's state each time it's used by implementing CRUD functionality to record visual and descriptive records.

 * As an Amazon delivery drive, I want to quickly create and save records of the van so I have enough time to safely perform essential morning duties.
