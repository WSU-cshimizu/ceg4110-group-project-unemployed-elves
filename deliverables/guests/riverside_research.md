# Guest Lecture Response
* **Guest Lecturer:** `Tom Irlbeck`
* **Company:** `Riverside Research`
* **Date:** `Thursday 10/10/2024`

## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**:
 * As your team is results-driven, how could you manage to hire such motivated individuals who want to make the difference? How can you determine if a person is not right for your team? Do you assess this during the interview, or do you evaluate it after they are already working with you?
* **Question 2**: You emphasized that user stories are king. Have there ever been any exceptions to this trend or rule where a developer story has been created and implemented?


## Lessons Learned
* Always try to conduct research and work for actual users who need help. That is why user stories are better than requirement specifications. (According to the lecturer)
* They use capacity planning where they estimate 60-70% of the 40 hours at work will actually go towards working. This means that projects are planned and scheduled to account for the 30-40% loss in time, making things more realistic. Hopefully, this would result in decreased burnout and fatigue for developers. The lesson learned here is that some companies think of the long term impacts of pushing employees too hard. This will be something to look out/ask for during interviews.
* They have users create journey maps which could be a helpful idea to pursue/learn about. Journey maps could help flesh out user stories so that the projection of the project and its features are more defined.
* They do a good job targetting the right users to create user stories. Specifically, they get information from the subset of people that would actually use the product AND are happy to give feedback about their experience and opinions. This helps tailor the user stories more towards what the users want, increasing the chance people will use the product.


## Difference between class lecture and guest lecture
 * Riverside research uses user stories like base units to comprise and flesh out bigger picture features and demands. Specifically, themes are comprised of epics and epics are comprised of user stories.
 * Riverside heavily discourages user stories created from a developers perspective because the customer is king. Our project has an entire section dedicated towards developer user stories.
 * Todd emphasized that the Agile methodology is used to support the developers and their work instead of the company. There was also an emphasis put on Agile as an "adjective" rather than a methodology.
