# Guest Lecture Response
* **Guest Lecturer:** `Scott Duberstein`
* **Date:** `Thursday 11/21/2024`

## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**:  When you work in different fields and have many hobbies, such as programming, boxing, and videography, it can feel like there's not enough time to really master all of them. How do you deal with the feeling that you can't excel at everything, even when you're trying? Is the idea not about the end goal, but about the journey (improving)?
* **Question 2**: Are there any fields where programming can be applied as an art - to express your feelings, not just satisfy intellectual curiosity?

## Lessons Learned
* If you understand your behavior, skills, and yourself (self-worth), nobody can shake or rock your boat. This is very important at work because it helps you deal with imposter syndrome.
* During the interview, be prepared to decompose and explain general concepts using approaches from software engineering, such as divide and conquer for tackling large problems. You should also be able to articulate how you would solve a specific problem (shopping cart example).

## Difference between class lecture and guest lecture
* Freelancing gives you the freedom to choose whatever SWE methodology or approach you desire as long as the finished product is deemed acceptable by the client. This means that freelancing developers can forego user stories and the like if they have a better, alternative way of doing things.
* The principles of SWE are not enough when starting a career as a freelance developer because of the need to find clients and work in a highly competitive, low barrier to entry market. This means that people who want to go down this path need the skills that would typically be handled for you by other employees at the company.
