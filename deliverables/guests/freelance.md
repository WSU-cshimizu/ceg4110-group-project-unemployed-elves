## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**:  When you work in different fields and have many hobbies, such as programming, boxing, and videography, it can feel like there's not enough time to really master all of them. How do you deal with the feeling that you can't excel at everything, even when you're trying? Is the idea not about the end goal, but about the journey (improving)?
* **Question 2**: Are there any fields where programming can be applied as an art - to express your feelings, not just satisfy intellectual curiosity?

## Lessons Learned
* If you understand your behavior, skills, and yourself (self-worth), nobody can shake or rock your boat. This is very important at work because it helps you deal with imposter syndrome.
