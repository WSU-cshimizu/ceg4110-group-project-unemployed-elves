# Guest Lecture Response

## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**: It was mentioned that there is a point system that measures performance based on the number of user stories completed. Is there any benefit of being in first (having the most points) or any drawback from being in last? Has anyone ever been fired because they didn't meet the point satisfactory point threshold?
* **Question 2**: How often do developers go on call or have to work outside the normal 9-5 working hours? Is this common for junior developers? Has anything disasterous occured in the past from not having people on call during project launches?


## Lessons Learned
* Developers have to go on call during product launches so they can handle potential problems that pop up. Typically I've associated on-call-responsibilities with jobs in the medical field like doctors for an example so this was definitely eye opening.
* It's incredibly difficult to shift the tech stack to something new. It costs millions of dollars for what might initially seem to be an easy change. Specifically, they use AngularJS instead of newer technologies like React and don't plan on making any changes because the inconvenience posed by the shift would far outweigh any reaped benefit.
* They used AngularJS in the past and have been mostly satisfied with the technology. However, there was one point where the creators of AngularJS seemingly recreated the entire language in the span of one update, causing major issues. The lesson learned here is that the creators of a tech stack have the potential to destroy millions of projects and businesses with just a singular update.


## Difference between class lecture and guest lecture
 * They use more than just user stories as the foundation for features. They also use roadmaps and "epics" which I assume is a collection of user stories. 
 * They give developer teams the freedom to choose which methodology approach they choose like Agile, Scrum, Kanban, etc. It appears that other companies have these types of decisions made for them so it's interesting to see the different ways flexibility is granted to developers.
