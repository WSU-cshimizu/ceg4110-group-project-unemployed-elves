# Guest Lecture Response
* **Guest Lecturer:** `Leland Vakarian`
* **Company:** `Mitre`
* **Date:** `Thursday 11/7/2024`

## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**: Does MITRE work on projects that are not directly related to sensitive information (and as a result, do not require citizenship and clearance)?
* **Question 2**: What types of job environments did you dislike or enjoy the most (ie government vs private, big company vs startup, etc)?
* **Question 3**: Have you published any video games and made any money?


## Lessons Learned
* The most widely used Agile tool, according to the lecturer, is Kanban.
* In the early stages of the career explore a variety of job types and company structures, including different sectors, and business models, as well as freelancing, to understand your preferences.
* Don't try to learn everything because there is there too much to learn. Instead, be selective and purposeful in the knowledge you pursue.
* There is a full-stack development tree that guides people on the technologies and skillsets needed to be an effective developer within this job domain.
* Don't become too emotionally attached to projects because the tech stack used or the code you created is always subject to be changed, deleted, or go unused. Instead try to be more adaptable to the needs of the project.

## Difference between class lecture and guest lecture
* DevOps is incredibly similar to the SWE process.
* Companies interpret the Agile methodology from so many different perspectives that the term has last a lot of it's meaning. However, it seems that specific subsets of the Agile methodology like Kanban still retain a common enough interpretation that meaning can still be attributed to the term.
