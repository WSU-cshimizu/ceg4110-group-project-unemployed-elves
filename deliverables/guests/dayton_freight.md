## Pertinent Questions
* **Question 1**: Why was a propriety language written for the tech stack vs using an already existing solution: "RPG for the IBMI (propriety language)?"
* **Question 2**: The question again concerns prioritization.
Let’s imagine I’m a PPC manager, and among other things, I noticed that the drop-down window leading to the company’s products on our website disappears too quickly. It’s difficult to click on the products and select them. Simple UI/UX problem. I see that users are clicking on the site from his ads, but they are not progressing further. I'm sure that this is due to the inconvenient drop-down window, not my ads.
What if it’s impossible to understand how much money the company is losing due to such a minor issue?
In this case, the business analyst works with the PPC manager to figure out the task prioritization, but is the responsibility entirely on the business analyst in the end?
Is the manager simply obligated to report the issue and explain it? Or is it always a team effort and shared responsibility?


## Lessons Learned
* Communication occurs 4-5 hours out of an 9 hour day which is a lot more frequent than I assumed.

It's interesting that they require developers to understand the "why" behind user stories purpose. This awareness helps the developer identify and implement issues that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. This tip could be applied to our project to improve our user story implementation.

*  Pay attention not only to companies that directly supply software but also to other companies, such as product-based and service companies, when searching for a job.

## Difference between SDLC lesson and guest lecture
 * **Definition and purpose of user stories:** In class, we discussed that a user story is not necessarily a strict software system requirement but rather a way to capture user needs in simple terms.
   But, Tim said that in his  company, user stories are used on their Kanban board to assign specific tasks to developers, so treating them as more concrete work items.
