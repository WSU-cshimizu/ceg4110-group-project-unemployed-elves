* Meeting minutes management
  * Create W7 meeting minutes

### Notes
#### Project Management
* Mariia: What are the final thoughts about the requirements?
  * Greg, Dipesh: I think we should rename "Name" to "First Name."
  * Greg: I also suggest adding VIN, license plate, and license state fields, as well as removing "Issue Status." "Issue Type" should be a checklist according to the Amazon DVIC.
  * I also suggest removing "Driver ID" from the second form for clarity.
  * Everyone: Agree.

#### Classwork
  * Everyone: Let's try to draw the actual data-flow diagram for the first login page.
      * Everyone: Draw and discuss: input/output as slanted rectangles, action-based-on-decision as rhombuses.
