### Administrivia
* Time: 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM
* Location: Fawcett Hall 204

### Agenda

  * What we should do to finish first page frontend and start to work on backend.
  * How MV design specification in our case may looks like.
* Meeting minutes management
  * Create W8 meeting minutes

### Notes
#### Project Management
* Greg: I'm working on the UI for the second page now. It's taking time because I'm not familiar with Figma.
* Sameer: I can update the Requirement Specification according to the template, which states that it should use "shall."
* Dipesh: I've finished the frontend for the first page, but I need to discuss if we need to add anything there.
  * Everyone: Could you send it to Discord for further discussion?
  * Dipesh: Ok.
* Mariia: I can work on the Design Specification. I'm considering adding a data flow diagram first, followed by a UML diagram, but the UML diagram is not a top priority at this stage.
 * Everyone: Let's stick with this plan.
* Mariia: By the way, after Dipesh finishes the first page, should we continue with our feature-driven development and complete the first page with backend and database integration as well?
  * Everyone: Yes, that makes sence.
