## Meeting #1 - Tuesday 9/17

### Administrivia
* Time: 11:00 AM - 12:20 PM
* Location: Fawcett Hall 204
* Scribe: Greg Terrell

### Agenda
* Discuss SDP issues

    * Don't want to upload anything right before 5 PM Friday
  * Have some user stories uploaded to GitHub prior to class Thursday
* Explore proposed architecture
  * Draw on board a visualization of the planned approach

### Notes
* Mariia: The MSV is missing from the Timeline Gantt chart among other specification documents.
  * Greg: I realized I misinterpreted the instructions and need to update the timeline section. I started writing the page 2 hours before the deadline, causing me to make some mistakes.
* Mariia: Let's complete a rough draft of assignments at least one day prior to the due date so there is time to review our work. This would help resolve any mistakes prior to the deadline. Specifically, let's finish the user stories assignment before Friday this week.
  * Everyone: Agrees
  * Greg: I can fix the timeline and complete one user story by next class.
* Mariia: Also, we need to incorporate test planning into the SDP timeline. It's a requirement for the course.
* Sameer: We need two user stories per person with at least one testing story per graduate student.

### Action Items
These are generally distilled from the notes. Essentially, these are "by the next meetings, _this person_ will take _this action_."
