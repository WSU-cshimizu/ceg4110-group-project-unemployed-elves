* Notes
Poor ui design typically incorporates inconsistent ui elements throughout the project. Some examples are using different colors for the same element types ie using orange for a submission button on page 1 but then using blue for the submission button on the second page. Additionally, try to avoid harsh and noisy design implementations like using dark black as the dropdown shadow of a button. Subtlety is key. Elements of the same type that perform different functions need to have different styles so the user can easily understand how to use the tool. Text used needs to follow hierarchal design where titles are big and emphasized while paragraph text is smaller. Unclear or poorly designed icons can confuse and discourage the user from continuing to use the tool. Bad icon designs use images instead of vectors and convey an unclear purpose. Any error messages displayed need to be clear about the encountered issue and give the user instructions on what to do next. For an example if a password doesn't match, don't print "Error". Instead, the form should say "Password is incorrect, if you don't remember your password, click here to reset it." Avoid using irrelevant or poor quality images. This can make the tool seem to be of lower quality.

Keep the design clean and uncluttered. Every element should have a purpose. Ensure the instructions for the user is clear and easy to follow. The navigation system should be accessible and intuitive. However, try to avoid overly simplistic designs ie a page with just a title and a search bar.
