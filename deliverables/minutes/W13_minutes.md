### Notes
* Mariia: I got the backend to work. The application can successfully extract the content from the form on the first UI page, query the database using the data,
then the db can hand off the reponse to the backend where the user can be authenticated in.
* Mariia: I've also completed most of code for data extraction and db storing

* Mariia: The backend relies on the HTML element names and ids so be careful in how you modify the html content of each page.
* Mariia: Additionally, we should be hesitant about adding new elements or features without planning because this will cause problems on the backend as well.
  * Greg: Ok, sounds good.
